                    <p>
                        The focus of this school lies on alpine snowpack field measurements combined with theoretical lessons in the 
                        classroom. Students are supervised by a team of lecturers, experts in various snow-related fields and from 
                        different countries worldwide. Field measurements will be done in small groups of 3-4 students. Each group of 
                        students will have to prepare a report describing the methods, results and interpretation of the data they 
                        will have collected over the week, in addition to other inputs that could be provided (modelling data for 
                        example). The course corresponds to 3 ETCS-Points. The winter school is listed in the coursebook of the doctoral 
                        school at EPFL Lausanne. To receive full credit, a report taking 40 hours of homework must be handed in and will 
                        be evaluated.

                <p>
                    Covering up to 49% of the total land surface in midwinter in the northern hemisphere, snow is a crucial 
                    component of the cryosphere. Snow plays a key role in our environnment, with social and economical 
                    implications such as the climate change, natural hazard, tourisms, etc. How does snow behave and interact 
                    with its surrounding largely depends on its microstructure, which varies widely from light dendritic 
                    snowflakes to small rounded grains or dense melt crusts for instance. Measuring and characterizing snow is 
                    therefore essential.

                    Great advances have been made over the past 15 years toward more quantitative, objective characterization of 
                    snow, allowing for a better, more physical description of the processes; they came along with new 
                    measurements techniques. These improved quantification methods of the snow cover must be spread to the 
                    cryosphere scientists community, and beyond, as beneficial to many applications in this field, e.g. hydrology, 
                    climatology, avalanche forecasting or earth observation from space.

                    The 6th Snow Science Winter School will teach these modern techniques of snow measurements. The school 
                    consists of a field training complemented by theoretical lessons. It includes the practice with some of 
                    the state-of-the-art snow measurement techniques (specific surface area by reflection and spectroscopy, 
                    near-infrared photography, high-resolution penetrometry, micro-tomography, etc). Students will learn 
                    about how to characterize snow cover, what are the fundamental processes responsible for its evolution, 
                    and how does it interacts with the environment. For this edition, a special focus will be on snow in a 
                    changing climate, impact on human and nature.
