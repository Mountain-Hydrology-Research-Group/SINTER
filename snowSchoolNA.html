                    <p>
                        This course will give fundamental training to students in making and analyzing snow measurements 
                        including depth, density, water equivalence, grain size and shape, stratigraphy, temperature and 
                        hardness. Students completing this course will be able to perform high-quality fieldwork and design 
                        studies making snowpack measurements.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>By the end of the course, students should be able to do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excavate and prepare a snow pit</li>
                        <li>Measure profiles of density, snow temperature, grain size, and hardness</li>
                        <li>Characterize stratigraphy and layering, snow surface roughness, and snow grain types</li>
                        <li>Use a Federal snow sampler, an avalanche probe, a Magnaprobe, and other snow measurement equipment.</li>
                        <li>Design their own experiment for sampling snow based on specific scientific objectives.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>
                    Snow covers a large portion of the Earthâ€™s mid- and high-latitude land surface for extended periods every 
                    year. For humans, the snow that accumulates in mountains and forests in the form of snow is crucial, 
                    providing melt water to about 2 billion people on Earth (Mankin et al., 2015). It is equally important for 
                    virtually all humans in the way it regulates essential climate processes through the snow albedo effect 
                    (Kellogg, 1973; Groisman et al., 1994; Lemke et al., 2007) and through its superb insulating properties 
                    (Goodrich, 1982; Mellor, 1964; Sturm et al., 1997). Quite simply, any change in global snow quality or 
                    quantity is likely to have serious climatic societal consequences for all of us (Barnett et al., 2005; 
                    Mankin et al., 2015; NASA, 2016). Accurate snowpack property measurements are needed as ground truth for 
                    remotely sensed data, as input for hydrological models, as input to ecological models, and as data when 
                    making avalanche forecasts. There are two reasons a snow scientist needs to know how to make high-quality 
                    measurements and have an understanding of what those measurements actually mean and represent in the real world. 
                    First, because they collect and use field data for their own research purposes. Second, because they use snowpack 
                    data from field practitioners or other sources and need to understand both the accuracy and the richness of the 
                    data they are using. The curriculum assumes little prior knowledge and experience on the part of the students, 
                    and begins with field and snow safety, then progresses to simple but critical snow measurements like depth, 
                    density, and snow water equivalent. Students are divided into teams and paired with an instructor then tasked with 
                    making field measurements that simulate what would be required in actual field campaigns. Daylight hours are spent almost 
                    entirely out in the snow, but in the evenings students work collectively to produce presentations of the results of the 
                    days measurements, and listen to lectures about field measurements, sampling design, handling of data, and more advanced 
                    measurement topics.
